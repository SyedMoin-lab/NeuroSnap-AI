## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
Our design uses a sophisticated color scheme based on OKLCH color space for better perceptual uniformity:

**Light Mode:**
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.705 0.213 47.604)` - Warm orange/amber for call-to-action elements
- **Background**: `oklch(1 0 0)` - Pure white for clean, modern feel
- **Foreground**: `oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823)` - Dark blue-gray for readable text
- **Secondary**: `oklch(0.967 0.001 286.375)` - Light gray for subtle backgrounds
- **Accent**: Matching secondary for consistent hover states

**Dark Mode:**
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.646 0.222 41.116)` - Adjusted amber for dark backgrounds
- **Background**: `oklch(0.141 0.005 285.823)` - Deep blue-gray
- **Foreground**: `oklch(0.985 0 0)` - Near-white for high contrast

This color system provides:
- Excellent accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Professional, modern appearance
- Smooth dark/light mode transitions
